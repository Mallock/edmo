ED MISSION OPERATOR — WEBSITE FOLDER
====================================

WHAT THIS IS
  A complete, self-contained website. No database, no PHP, no build step.

  index.html                              the page
  img/                                    screenshots + icons
  ED-Mission-Operator-1.0.0-setup.exe       the Windows installer (~131 MB)
  ED-Mission-Operator-1.0.0-amd64.deb       Linux beta, Ubuntu/Debian (~147 MB)
  ED-Mission-Operator-1.0.0-x86_64.AppImage Linux beta, any distro (~230 MB)

HOW TO PUT IT ON YOUR WEB HOTEL
  1. Open your web hotel's File Manager (or connect with FTP, e.g. FileZilla).
  2. Go into the public_html folder (sometimes called www or htdocs).
  3. Upload the CONTENTS of this folder (index.html, img folder, the .exe)
     — not the "site" folder itself, unless you want the page at /site/.
  4. Visit your domain in a browser. Done.

NOTES
  * The installer is ~131 MB. Browser-based file managers sometimes limit
    uploads (often to 100 MB) — if the .exe upload fails, use FTP instead,
    or upload it to a file service and change the download link in
    index.html (search for "ED-Mission-Operator-1.0.0-setup.exe").
  * 1.0.0 is the self-contained release: the app can now install its OWN AI.
    Settings -> AI engine -> "This app (no other software needed)" fetches a
    small llama.cpp runtime (Vulkan, ~30 MB, works on AMD/Intel/NVIDIA) plus a
    Gemma vision model (~4-6 GB, picked to fit the user's graphics card). The
    download shows progress, resumes after a cancel, and the engine is started
    and stopped by the app. LM Studio still works and stays supported - pick it
    in the same dropdown - so existing users lose nothing.
    Also in 1.0: the copilot follows the whole session (events + screen) and
    reacts in context, with a tunable involvement level; exobiology sampling
    ranges and payout estimates; and four opt-in community lookups the operator
    calls only when asked (Spansh routes, galaxy-wide markets via Ardent
    Insight, the EDAstro exploration catalogue, and the Galnet news wire).
  * All three installers are 1.0.0. The Linux .deb + .AppImage are built on a
    Linux host (a WSL Ubuntu 24.04 checkout here) via `npm run tauri build`.
    Build them with a PURELY LINUX PATH — WSL's interop appends the Windows
    PATH, and linuxdeploy walks every entry and dies on /mnt/c/WINDOWS/...
    permission errors:
      export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
    Run scripts/fetch-tts.sh first if src-tauri/resources/tts-linux is missing.
  * When you ship a new version, copy the new setup .exe here, rename it to
    match, and update the version number + file name in index.html
    (it appears in the version strip, the download button, and step 01).
  * Everything else (fonts) loads from Google Fonts automatically.
